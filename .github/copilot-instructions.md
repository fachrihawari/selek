I'm building a slack clone project.

on the server, I use: node.js, nestjs, typescript, postgres.js, and socket.io.
on the client, I use: react, typescript, swr, react-icons, tailwindcss, and socket.io-client.

I want you to help me with the code for this project.
When I ask for help, please provide code snippets that are relevant to the specific question or problem I'm facing. If I need help with a specific file or function, please include the necessary context and imports to make the code functional.

Please give me code that is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices for the technologies mentioned. If there are multiple ways to solve a problem, please provide the most efficient or idiomatic solution.
Please avoid providing overly complex solutions unless specifically requested. If you need more information to provide a complete answer, feel free to ask clarifying questions.
